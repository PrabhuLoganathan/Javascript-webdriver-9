Downloads a suitable version of Chromedriver based on your Chrome version so you don't need to take care about it.


## Installation
You can use either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the packages
```javascript
yarn add autochromedriver
```
```javascript
npm install autochromedriver
```

## Use of the package
The package **will download a Chromedriver executable inside the node_modules/.bin/ folder** based on your Chrome version. So you can reference it inside your code.

## Issues or Questions
If there's any problem with the package, questions or even improvements that could be included, feel free to share your thoughts inside the Issue section

**Feel free to collaborate with this project, any help would be appreciated :)**
