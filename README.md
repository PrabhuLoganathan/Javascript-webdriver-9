Downloads a suitable version of Chromedriver based on your Chrome version so you don't need to take care about it.


## Installation
You can use either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the packages
```javascript
yarn add autochromedriver
```
```javascript
npm install autochromedriver
```

## Use of the package
The package **will download a Chromedriver executable inside the node_modules/.bin/ folder** based on your Chrome version. So you can reference it inside your code.

## Issues or Questions
If there's any problem with the package, questions or even improvements that could be included, feel free to share your thoughts inside the Issue section

## About the author
My name is Lucas Werner and I've decided to start this project up to try to improve the task of download an appropiate ChromeDriver version, that it's needed for some libraries like Nightwatch or Selenium.
I'm a computer engineer working in Oracle Cloud in Prague. 

I love my job and I'm focused on JS technologies, both frontend and backend technologies ( or at least I try ).

And last but not least, of course 
**Feel free to collaborate with this project, any help would be appreciated :)**
